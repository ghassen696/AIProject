### New Tab: üéØ Productivity Analytics
- **Workload Adherence**: Real-time adherence metrics
- **Weekly Reports**: Trend analysis and patterns
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Priority-based issue identification
- **Action Items**: Refresh analytics and generate reports

### Enhanced Metrics
- Adherence Score (0-100%)
- Completion Rate by Category
- Efficiency Gap Analysis
- Focus Score Tracking
- Task Complexity Assessment

## üîß Implementation Details

### Enhanced Classification Prompt
```python
def classify_chunk_ollama(chunk_content: list, model="llama3.2:latest"):
    prompt = """Analyze this employee activity log and classify into meaningful task categories:
    
    Return valid JSON with these exact fields:
    - category: Choose from ["Code Development", "Documentation", "Communication", "Research", "Administrative", "Testing", "Design", "Data Analysis", "System Administration", "Other"]
    - subcategory: Specific task type (e.g., "Python Coding", "Email", "Meeting", "API Testing", "UI Design")
    - confidence: Number between 0.0 and 1.0
    - reasoning: Brief explanation of classification
    - time_spent: Estimated minutes spent on this task
    - productivity_level: Choose from ["High", "Medium", "Low"]
    - focus_score: Number between 0.0 and 1.0 (how focused they were)
    - task_complexity: Choose from ["Simple", "Moderate", "Complex"]
    """
```

### Workload Adherence Algorithm
```python
def calculate_workload_adherence(es, employee_id, date_str, planned_workload):
    # 1. Fetch actual activities for the day
    # 2. Match categories between planned and actual
    # 3. Calculate adherence metrics
    # 4. Identify bottlenecks
    # 5. Generate recommendations
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Run Enhanced Daily Pipeline
```bash
cd PythonStreamlit/test
python daily_pipeline.py
```

### 2. Assign Workloads
- Use the dashboard's "üìÇ Workload Management" tab
- Input planned tasks with categories and time estimates
- Assign to specific employees and dates

### 3. View Analytics
- Navigate to "üéØ Productivity Analytics" tab
- Select employee and date range
- Review adherence scores, weekly reports, and bottlenecks

### 4. Monitor Trends
- Track productivity patterns over time
- Identify recurring bottlenecks
- Use recommendations for workload optimization
